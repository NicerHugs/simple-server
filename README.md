Testing the waters with Node by writing a vanilla Node.js static server.

Serves any files requested from the public directory, provided they supply a file extension (eg: `.js`). If no file extension is supplied, index.html is served. The idea being that this would serve a spa specifically, and any url changes will be handled on the front end after initial page load.

Not tested. For learning purposes only.
